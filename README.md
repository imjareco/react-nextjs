This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You have install dependencies:

`npm install`

## Add enviroment file
Before to run the project, you should add '.env.local' file to load enviroment variables.

Put this in your **.env.local** file:

HOSTNAME=localhost\
PORT=3000\
HOST=http://$HOSTNAME:$PORT

First, run the development server:

`npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
